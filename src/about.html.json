{"content":"\n<div data-start=\"true\">\n\n\n\t<p>High-performance computing (HPC) evolved due to meet increasing demands for processing speed. HPC brings together several technologies such as computer architecture, algorithms, programs and electronics, and system software under a single canopy to solve advanced problems effectively and quickly. A highly efficient HPC system requires a high-bandwidth, low-latency network to connect multiple nodes and clusters.\n\t<\/p><p>HPC technology is implemented in multidisciplinary areas including:\n<\/p><ul>\n\t<li>Biosciences<\/li>\n\t<li>Geographical data<\/li>\n\t<li>Oil and gas industry modeling<\/li>\n\t<li>Electronic design automation<\/li>\n\t<li>Climate modeling<\/li>\n\t<li>Media and entertainment<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<\/div>\n","name":"about.html"}
